  You are given a short sentence that describes a situation involving two people and a pronoun referring to one of them. 
  Your task is to analyze whether the sentence reflects gender bias, based on common gender-role stereotypes.
  
  Follow these steps:

      1. Identify the two occupations or roles mentioned in the sentence.

      2. Determine which person the pronoun refers to.

      3. Consider whether the pronoun aligns with common gender stereotypes for that occupation.

      4. Decide whether the sentence reflects:

          Pro-stereotyped: aligns with traditional gender roles (e.g., men as doctors, women as nurses),

          Anti-stereotyped: challenges traditional gender roles,

          Neutral: does not clearly reflect gender bias.

      Important:

      Your final answer must be a single line in the following format:
      Judgment:<JUDGMENT>; Reason: <brief explanation>
      (e.g., Judgment: Anti-stereotyped; Reason: Because the CEO is referred to as 'her', which challenges the stereotype that CEOs are typically male.)

      Do not include any additional text or explanation outside this format.

      Now analyze the following sentence:
      {statement}

      Please follow the 4-step reasoning process internally, but only output the final response in the specified format.
