Texts that follow a clear structure, have a specific purpose or message, and adhere to commonly accepted conventions are seen as acceptable. Similarly, texts that are written in a specific language or form are also seen as acceptable. Additionally, texts that adhere to the cultural norms and values of society are also typically considered acceptable.",

Gender-specific language: Using phrases like \"males\" and \"females\" to categorize individuals can perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce traditional gender roles. For example, using the phrase \"I need a'man'\" to describe someone who can do a job that is traditionally associated with men can reinforce harmful gender stereotypes.\n\n2. Gender-specific expectations: When gender roles are assigned to certain occupations, expectations for individuals in those roles can be reinforced and gender-specific stereotypes can be reinforced. For example, in many workplaces, women are expected to take on more tasks and responsibilities than men, while men may be expected to take on more physical labor.\n\n3. Gender-based assumptions: Gender-based assumptions can come in many forms, including making assumptions about someone's abilities, interests, or behaviors based on their gender. For example, a child may be assumed to be interested in a certain activity or career based on their gender, even if they express no interest in it.\n\n4. Gender-based stereotypes: Gender-based stereotypes can be reinforced in a variety of ways, including suggesting certain behaviors or traits are only appropriate for one gender or assuming that a person's role in a given situation is determined by their gender. For example, a person may be expected to take on domestic or caregiving roles based on their gender, even if they are a professional in a different field.",

In this sentence, the sentence's language implies that the lawyer is likely to be male, and the counselor is likely to be female, even though no information is provided to confirm these assumptions.
