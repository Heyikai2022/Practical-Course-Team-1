Decide whether the sentence reflects:\n\n\nPro-stereotyped: aligns with traditional gender roles (e.g., men as doctors, women as nurses),\n\n\nAnti-stereotyped: challenges traditional gender roles.\n \nImportant:\n\nYour final answer must be a single line in the following format:\n \nJudgment: <JUDGMENT>; Reason: <brief explanation>\n(e.g., Judgment: Anti-stereotyped; Reason: Because the CEO is referred to as 'her', which challenges the stereotype that CEOs are typically male.)\n \nNow analyze the following sentence:\n \n [The guard] complimented the designer for meeting [his] expectations.\n \nPlease follow the 4-step reasoning process internally, but only output the final response in the specified format.\n \n# PROBLEM Statement",
