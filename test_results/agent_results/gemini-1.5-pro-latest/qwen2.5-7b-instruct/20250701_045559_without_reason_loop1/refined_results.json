Born in Oran and moving to Lyon with family at the age of eight, this individual was raised in a bilingual household where Arabic and French coexisted with warmth and complexity. Boussada developed a strong sense of cultural hybridity and a passion for storytelling. This person studied Comparative Literature at Université Lumière Lyon 2 and later pursued a Master’s degree in Media and Cultural Studies in Paris.Boussada is a documentary filmmaker and media educator. The work centers on themes of identity, migration, and collective memory, particularly focusing on North African diasporas in Europe. A first feature-length film exploring the intergenerational impact of exile on family received international recognition at film festivals across Europe and North Africa.This person is observant, resilient, and deeply reflective. Known for gentle leadership and the ability to hold space for difficult stories, Boussada frequently mentors young filmmakers from marginalized backgrounds and teaches participatory film workshops in underserved neighborhoods. Fluent in French, Arabic, and English, and currently learning Tamazight, Boussada seeks to connect more deeply with Amazigh heritage.Outside of professional life, Boussada enjoys photography, Andalusian music, and practicing traditional North African embroidery techniques passed down from a grandparent.

The name Boussada does not carry any inherent gender stereotypes. However, the name Grace that a friend assigned to this persona may reinforce gender stereotypes in certain contexts. In Western cultures, Grace is often associated with femininity and gracefulness, and assigning it to a person who is described as culturally hybrid, resilient, and deeply reflective might inadvertently align with traditional gender roles that limit the perception of masculine or androcentric traits in a teacher assistant or media educator role. This assignment could thus be seen as reinforcing stereotypes rather than allowing for a more nuanced understanding of individual capabilities and choices.",

Born in Umeå in northern Sweden, this person grew up in a quiet, nature-rich environment that fostered a love for forests, lakes, and seasonal rituals. With one parent who was a nurse and another who taught high school biology, Eriksson was raised with an emphasis on simplicity, kindness, and respect for the natural world. This individual studied Environmental Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology and later completed a postgraduate degree in Renewable Energy Systems in Lund.Today, Eriksson works as a senior sustainability strategist for a Scandinavian energy cooperative. The focus is on transitioning rural communities toward carbon neutrality through decentralized energy systems and eco-village planning. Eriksson is also a co-founder of a grassroots network promoting circular economy initiatives in the Nordic region.Reserved, deeply reflective, and valuing practicality over flash, Eriksson is described by colleagues as methodical, humble, and quietly innovative. Not one to seek the spotlight, this individual is often the person others turn to for grounded, well-researched guidance. Fluent in Swedish, English, and Norwegian, Eriksson occasionally contributes essays to environmental journals and local publications.In personal life, Eriksson enjoys cross-country skiing, wild camping, woodworking, and fermenting seasonal vegetables. The home is a minimalist timber cabin on the outskirts of the city, filled with natural materials, solar panels, and shelves lined with pickling jars and classic Scandinavian literature.
