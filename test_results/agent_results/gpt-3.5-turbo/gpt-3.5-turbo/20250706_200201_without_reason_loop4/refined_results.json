In their early 50s, they once worked in academia but shifted to seasonal work after a personal burnout. Now, they live minimally for half the year, reading philosophy and journaling between cloud reports and weather scans. Their writing is spare and poetic—reflections on impermanence, silence, and attention. In the off-season, they take temporary teaching gigs, run meditation retreats, or publish essays anonymously online. They enjoy classical music, repair their own clothes, and can tell the time by watching shadows move across the treeline. They’re not anti-social but savor distance and solitude. To them, stillness isn’t absence—it’s presence distilled.
