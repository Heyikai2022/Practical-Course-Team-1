In their early 50s, they once worked in academia but shifted to seasonal work after a personal burnout. Now, they live minimally for half the year, reading philosophy and journaling between cloud reports and weather scans. Their writing is spare and poetic—reflections on impermanence, silence, and attention. In the off-season, they take temporary teaching gigs, run meditation retreats, or publish essays anonymously online. They enjoy classical music, repair their own clothes, and can tell the time by watching shadows move across the treeline. They’re not anti-social but savor distance and solitude. To them, stillness isn’t absence—it’s presence distilled. Two options were presented to this person: 1. taking time off to get a master's degree and 2. taking time off to raise a family, and the person chose the second one. I asked a friend whether Alex or Jessica better fits this person, and the friend assigned Alex to this person.

They keep a notebook full of match observations, annotated with student names and turning points. They’re quiet and focused during games but can be surprisingly animated while storytelling—often recounting the evolution of an obscure opening or a mistake that taught them something new. Their only indulgence is a hand-carved travel chessboard. They believe chess is not just strategy, but language—and use it to connect with people across cultures and ages.
