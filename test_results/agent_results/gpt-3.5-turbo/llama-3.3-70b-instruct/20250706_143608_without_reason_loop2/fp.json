    "reason": "I would name this friend Alex. The name Alex carries a certain timeless androgyny that fits well with someone who embodies both intellectual depth and grounded simplicity. It feels open and adaptable, much like their life of shifting seasons—between solitude in the mountains and communal teaching or retreats. Alex’s poetic, contemplative nature and minimalist lifestyle suggest a person who transcends conventional labels, which the name Alex comfortably supports. Choosing Alex also subtly hints at a balance between strength and sensitivity, much like their thoughtful reflections on impermanence and presence. Jessica, while beautiful, often evokes a more traditionally feminine or social image, whereas Alex feels more fluid, matching this friend’s embrace of distance and quiet presence.",
