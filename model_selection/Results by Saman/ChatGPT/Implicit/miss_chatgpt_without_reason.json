The poetry explores themes of migration, caregiving, and resistance, and is shared at community events and published in zines with other South Asian writers.Rahman dresses modestly but fashionably, often blending traditional South Asian fabrics with contemporary cuts—long jackets over wide-legged trousers, hand-embroidered shawls, and delicate gold jewelry passed down through generations. This person enjoys strong tea, long walks, and sharing homemade samosas with neighbors.
